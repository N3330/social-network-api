# social-network-api

A social network API which allows users to share their thoughts and react to friends thoughts and add other users as friends. This project utilizes Express.js for routing, MongoDB for a database, and Mongoose. When server is started Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database.
